# Bubble Libraries

The libraries in this particular folder can only be used inside a Bubble based engine.
ANY Bubble engine will do, as long as it's a Bubble engine. When you use NIL outside of Bubble, then you can best ignore this entire folder and all its subfolders.

Most libraries here are zlib based, but please note that other licenses can apply for some of them, so always read the license text before using a library.
